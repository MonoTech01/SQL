## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for managing and manipulating data in databases. It helps you interact with data by allowing you to:
- **Define** the structure of the database.
- **Manipulate** the data in the database (add, update, delete).
- **Control access** to the database.
- **Query** to retrieve specific data.

SQL commands fall into different categories:
- **DDL**: Defines database structure (e.g., CREATE TABLE).
- **DML**: Manipulates data (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE).
- **DCL**: Manages permissions (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
- **Transaction Control**: Handles transactions (e.g., COMMIT).
- **Query**: Retrieves data.

## What is an SQL Script?

An **SQL script** is a series of SQL commands written together to perform a specific task. Scripts make tasks easier and faster, especially when dealing with large datasets. Instead of running individual commands repeatedly, you can run the script as a batch.

For example, if we need to update the work hours for many employees, a script can automate that process.

## Creating an SQL Script

To create an SQL script:
1. Open a text editor (like Notepad).
2. Write your SQL commands.
3. Save the file with a `.sql` extension (e.g., `update_studentstudytime.sql`).

## Running an SQL Script

To run an SQL script:
1. Open your database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio).
2. Load the script.
3. Execute the script to apply the changes to your database.

Most tools allow we to edit, save, and run the script easily.

## Summary:
- **SQL** is used to manage and query databases.
- **SQL scripts** automate tasks by grouping multiple SQL commands together.
- We can create SQL scripts with any text editor and run them using a database tool.
