# Database Programs

## Types of Database Programs
1. **Flat File Database (Single-File Database)**
   - Used for small-scale, simple needs with one user.
   - Stores data in a simple, tabular format (like Excel).
   - Limited to storing plain text data, not complex types like audio or video.
   - Example: **Microsoft Excel** (for personal use or small data sets).

2. **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**
   - Designed for larger datasets and multiple users.
   - Can handle complex data and interrelationships between records.
   - Supports more advanced data security and access controls.
   - Example: **Microsoft Access** (for small-medium businesses), **MySQL** (for personal use), **SQL Server** and **Oracle Database** (for large businesses).

## Key Differences Between Flat File and RDBMS:
- **Flat File**: Best for small datasets and single-user use.
- **RDBMS**: Better for handling large datasets, multiple users, and complex relationships between data.

## Examples:
- **Microsoft Access**: Simple RDBMS, good for small-medium businesses with limited concurrent users.
- **MySQL**: Free and suitable for personal or small business use.
- **SQL Server/Oracle**: Enterprise-grade RDBMS, used by large businesses for complex needs.

## Hightlights:
- **Flat File Databases** (like Excel) are best for small, personal use.
- **Relational Databases** (like MySQL, Access, SQL Server, Oracle) are for larger, more complex data needs, supporting multiple users and advanced interrelationships.
